This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in shell scripting: race conditions.  The `bug.sh` script showcases a scenario where two processes write to files concurrently. The outcome isn't deterministic, highlighting the unpredictability caused by this race condition. The `bugSolution.sh` script illustrates how to mitigate this using proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locking). This example emphasizes the need for careful consideration of concurrency when writing shell scripts, especially those involving file I/O.
